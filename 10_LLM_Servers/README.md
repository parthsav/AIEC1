**⚠️!!! PLEASE BE SURE TO SHUTDOWN YOUR DEDICATED ENDPOINT ON FIREWORKS AI WHEN YOU'RE FINISHED YOUR ASSIGNMENT !!!⚠️**

# Build 🏗️

In today's assignment, we'll be creating Fireworks AI endpoints, and then building a RAG application.

- 🤝 Breakout Room #1
  - Set-up Open Source Endpoint (Instructions [here](./ENDPOINT_SETUP.md)) ((This process may take 15-20min.))
  - Test Endpoint and Embeddings with the `endpoint_slammer.ipynb` notebook.

- 🤝 Breakout Room #2
  - Use the Open Source Endpoints to build a RAG LangGraph application

# Ship 🚢

The completed notebook and your RAG app/notebook!

### Deliverables

- A short Loom of either:
  - the notebook and the RAG application you built for the Main Homework Assignment; or
  - the notebook you created for the Advanced Build

# Share 🚀

Make a social media post about your final application!

### Deliverables

# Submitting You Homework

## Main Homework Assignment

Follow these steps to prepare and submit your homework assignment:

1. Follow the instructions in `ENDPOINT_SETUP.md`
2. Replace both `model` values in `endpoint_slammer.ipynb` with the `gpt-oss` endpoint you created in Step 1
3. Run the code cells in `endpoint_slammer.ipynb`
4. Respond to the questions in the section below
5. Build a sample RAG
6. Record a Loom video reviewing what you have learned from this session

## Questions

### ❓ Question #1:

What is the difference between serverless and dedicated endpoints?

#### ✅ Answer:

Serverless endpoints run on shared, provider-managed infrastructure. You send requests to a public model endpoint (for example, accounts/fireworks/models/gpt-oss-20b similar to one we used in endpoint_slammer.ipynb) and pay only for the tokens or requests you use. There's no need to provision GPUs or manage infrastructure, and you can start using the model immediately. Since the underlying compute is shared with other customers, latency and throughput can fluctuate during periods of high demand. On the plus side, there are no idle infrastructure costs.

Dedicated (on-demand) endpoints reserve compute exclusively for your deployment, for example by creating a deployment with `firectl create deployment` and configuring `min-replica` and `max-replica`. This gives you dedicated capacity, more consistent latency, predictable performance under concurrent load, and control over how your deployment scales. The trade off is cost: you pay for the reserved replicas even when they're idle, so it's important to shut down the deployment when you're finished to avoid unnecessary charges.


### ❓ Question #2:

Why is it important to consider token throughput and latency when choosing an LLM for user-facing applications?

#### ✅ Answer:
User facing applications are evaluated in real time so responsiveness is necessary. User expects answers to beging stream within few seconds as supposed to minutes. Latency which means the time taken for first token and total response time has a direct impact on the user experience. If we have high latency it makes our chatbots, search and our application in general feel slow or unreliatble increasing the likelihood of people abondoning our app.

**Token throughput**, measured in tokens generated per second, determines how quickly a complete response is delivered and how many users an endpoint can handle simultaneously. Higher throughput allows responses to finish faster and supports more concurrent requests. Lower throughput, on the other hand, leads to longer wait times and reduces the number of requests an endpoint can serve before requests begin queueing or timing out, as demonstrated by the `endpoint_slammer.ipynb` stress test.

When choosing an LLM endpoint, it's important to balance model quality with performance. A highly capable but slower model may be perfectly suitable for offline or batch processing, where response time isn't critical. For interactive applications, however, low latency and sufficient throughput are essential to deliver a responsive experience under expected user traffic.


## Activity 1: RAGAS Evaluation with Cost Analysis

Use RAGAS to evaluate your open-source Fireworks AI powered RAG app against an OpenAI `gpt-4.1-mini` powered equivalent. Compare retrieval quality, answer faithfulness, and end-to-end accuracy across both providers.

Additionally, instrument both pipelines with **LangSmith** to capture token usage and cost per query. Use LangSmith's tracing and cost dashboards to compare the total cost of running each provider at scale. Include your evaluation results, cost breakdown, and analysis in your Loom video.

## Advanced Activity: Local Models

Swap out the Fireworks AI endpoints for **locally-running open-source models** using [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) or another local inference server of your choice. Run both your embedding model and your chat model locally, and rebuild the RAG pipeline on top of them.

- Compare quality and latency between the local setup and your Fireworks AI hosted endpoint.
- Reflect: what are the trade-offs of local models vs. managed endpoints in a production setting?

Include your findings and a demo in your Loom video.
